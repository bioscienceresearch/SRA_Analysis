CMV Fwd,CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTG,At 5' end of MCS in pCMV5 (4),"This is a ""Universal"" primer and should work in any vector that contains a CMV promoter. However, as with any primer, customers should still check for compatibility with their plasmid.",https://www.dnaseq.co.uk/resources/primers/standard-primers

M13 Fwd,GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG,Common to many plasmids (-20 version),"This primer does NOT work with Invitrogen Gateway vectors (e.g. pDONR221) due to a base mismatch at the 3' end. Our primer contains a ""G"" at the extreme 3' end, but the Gateway plasmids possess a ""C"" at this position. For sequencing Gateway vectors, please use the Gateway-specific primers we have.",https://www.dnaseq.co.uk/resources/primers/standard-primers

M13 Rev,GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG,Common to many plasmids,There is a base deletion in some pUC18 vectors that results in the M13Rev primer not binding. Details of this deletion can be found in the New England Biolabs catalogue (p136 of the 2003 catalogue). If you use pUC18 you may wish to use a different primer in case your plasmid is affected.,https://www.dnaseq.co.uk/resources/primers/standard-primers
